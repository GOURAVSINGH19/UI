import LoginPage from "@/components/docs/Login"
import { DocsPreview, DocsTable } from "../../../components/docs/DocsSurface"

## Overview

`Login` bundles an authentication hero, lightning badge, stacked inputs, and
social actions into a single, production-ready layout. It honors the same token
system as the rest of the marketing site, so headings, radius, and shadows feel
native out of the box.

## When to use

- Dedicated login routes where you want more storytelling than a plain card
- Billing or workspace gating experiences that need SOC2-grade polish
- Launch pages that showcase third-party auth providers alongside email/password

<Callout type="warning" title="Authentication">
  Remember to implement proper authentication logic. The demo component only shows the UI structure.
</Callout>

## Preview

<ComponentPreviewTabs
  component={<LoginPage />}
  source={
    <ComponentSource
      src="components/docs/Login.tsx"
      title="Login.tsx"
      language="tsx"
    />
  }
/>

## API Surface

<DocsTable
  headers={["Component", "Props", "Notes"]}
  rows={[
    [
      <code key="login">LoginPage</code>,
      "—",
      "Self-contained page component with internal state management. Clone it if you need to customize copy, providers, or theme tokens.",
    ],
  ]}
/>

## Accessibility

- Inputs forward `aria-*` attributes, so you can announce validation states.
- Buttons include real text labels—supplement icons with `aria-label` if you add more providers.
- Remember to handle authentication failures server-side; the demo form only logs to the console.
