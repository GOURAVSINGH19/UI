import LoginPage from "@/components/ui/Login"
import { DocsPreview, DocsTable } from "../../../components/docs/DocsSurface"

## Overview

`Login` bundles an authentication hero, lightning badge, stacked inputs, and
social actions into a single, production-ready layout. It honors the same token
system as the rest of the marketing site, so headings, radius, and shadows feel
native out of the box.

## Installation

Copy `apps/web/components/ui/Login.tsx` into your project or run:

```bash
pnpm dlx @workspace/cli add login
```

## When to use

- Dedicated login routes where you want more storytelling than a plain card
- Billing or workspace gating experiences that need SOC2-grade polish
- Launch pages that showcase third-party auth providers alongside email/password

## Preview

<DocsPreview inset className="bg-[var(--bg)]">
  <LoginPage />
</DocsPreview>

## Usage

```tsx
import LoginPage from "@/components/ui/Login";

export default function LoginRoute() {
  return <LoginPage />;
}
```

## API Surface

<DocsTable
  headers={["Component", "Props", "Notes"]}
  rows={[
    [
      <code key="login">LoginPage</code>,
      "—",
      "Self-contained page component with internal state management. Clone it if you need to customize copy, providers, or theme tokens.",
    ],
  ]}
/>

## Accessibility

- Inputs forward `aria-*` attributes, so you can announce validation states.
- Buttons include real text labels—supplement icons with `aria-label` if you add more providers.
- Remember to handle authentication failures server-side; the demo form only logs to the console.
